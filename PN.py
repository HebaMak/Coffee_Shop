# due to an error occurs in Auth0 
# I used these links 
# https://127.0.0.1:8100/login  ==> Application Login URI
# https://127.0.0.1:8100/logout ==> Application Logout URI
# the login page doesn't open with this link
# https://heba-salem.eu.auth0.com/authorize?audience=CoffeeShop&response_type=token&client_id=BRQ0yfJ5IlnbqxMln0lVDrsQXXSStRFT&redirect_uri=https://http://localhost:8100
#  can you provide me with the login & logout code

# also Auth0 requires https instead of http
